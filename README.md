cpanm-puppet-provider
=====================

This project seeks to contribute to the puppet code base a new native cpanm provider for Package['perl::module'] resources.  I develop primarily in perl, am busy these days bringing my infrastructure under puppet management, have almost no expereince with ruby and welcome collaborators.  Jump in, the water is fine.
